 Valleys In The Sky will both be a standalone gamemode where you can select during world creation, or you could build a portal to it in a normal world. The latter will be more like a safe haven where you can cultivate crops and transfer over to the overworld. The Valleys are of course, in the sky.

upgrades like Iron Scythe, Diamond Scythe, etc. Will be not be a separate item but instead will be extra data for the item.
